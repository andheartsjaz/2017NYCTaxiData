# 2017NYCTaxiData
As a part of my defense for my Data Analytics Certification, through General Assembly, March 2018.

The analysis, as completed in February 2018, was performed entirely via Excel and user computation.

I will post the project as it was submitted and then post a secondary file with my analysis given my experience as a Data Scientist.


Overview of Project - 2017 NYC Yellow Taxi Cab Analysis

I wanted to demonstrate a very fundamental principle, I felt at the time was plaguing Data Analysts and Project Managers:  We simply were using way too many grpahs and charts and no one truly knew how to make a decision without this.

Now, introspect, I understand and respect that as humans, we need visuals to comprehend complex topics and such... but, given the gravity of the project I was working on, and because I'm a stubborn Philosopher, I wanted to push this idea to the brink.

So!

I decided to perform the project using analysis of on dataset, but in acutality, I ended up analyzing 4 datasets!   

These were:  
2014-2017 Yellow Taxi Cab data
2014-2017 2016 Green Taxi Cab data 

At the time I felt I needed to really dig into the data, and, utilize the advantage of my Fortune 500 Finance background. Thankfully, myself and the Associate General Counsel at my former company had performed anlysis of similar variety under heavy pressure and considerable visiablity, so I was unafriad of attempting this with about 2.5 days of solid work time.
