# 2017NYCTaxiData
As a part of my defense for my Data Analytics Certification, through General Assembly, March 2018.

The analysis, as completed in February 2018, was performed entirely via Excel and user computation.

I will post the project as it was submitted and then post a secondary file with my analysis given my experience as a Data Scientist.
